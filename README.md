# Matching-Game
A matching game to increase my skill in javascript

This matching game is my largest project so far javascript wise. I learned a bit more on functions and little on recursive functions with the stopwatch function. I learned a lot more on css animations and how to utilize them within javascript. I also learned how to delete and add classes to elements in html with javascript. There is also the "nth-child" psuedo class I learned about and utilized to a degree. One thing I dislike and plan on fixing in future projects is how many of the same elements and repeating javascript functions I used for the snow. I plan on learning how to optimize that in the near future. One issue I still have as I upload this is when the game ends and the stopwatch stops. The snow goes haywire and sporatically changes X position. I have skimmed through and debugged step by step and could not find the issue. All the positions are set to absolute so their hitboxes should not conflict with each other either. I am setting this as a pre-release and plan on coming back to optimize it further and fix any issues once I have learned a lot more.
